# Text-Clock

Text-Clock can be used as a full screen app that runs in the browser. It displays the current time in German words.

## More Features

- Clock text updates every 5 minutes and each minute in between is indicated with a dot at the end of the last line.
- Text color changes during daytime. Shades are computed dynamically every 5 minutes in order to display smooth gradients. Currently 5 base colors (grey, yellow, green, blue, red) are in use.
- Positions of text blocks is calculated randomly but the resulting layout is always drawn in top-to-bottom reading order.

## Screenshots

Might add some screenshots when the whole thing is mounted at the wall.
